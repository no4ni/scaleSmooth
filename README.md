<b>Free and Open Source Image Upscaler</b></div><br>
<b>scaleSmooth</b> lets you enlarge and enhance low-resolution images using only math.<br>
Enlarge images and get more quality without losing accuracy (except contrastBoldScale) and hallucinations. It's just math!<br><br>

**scaleSmooth** is a windows application on .NET 8.0 on Visual Studio C#, but we'll be glad, if you create your repository of scaleSmooth / scaleRough / scaleFurry / contrastBoldScale / scaleSeparate / scaleBilinearApproximation for other platforms and languages (write me and I'll attach link to your repository) or commit here updates for optimization, batch, interface or more accuracy.<br>

**scaleSmooth** is algorithms by sequential calculations, so it's might be very slow (use fast/accurate regulator if it will be needed) and it can't parallelize by many CPU's or GPU (except scaleSeparate and scaleBilinearApproximation - now realized parallelize only by CPU's), but you can run as many copies of other methods at the same time as many logical CPU's you have without losing speed.<br>

Threshold, autoThreshold, Mean Cuvatute Blur, Median Blur, adjustment by Lanczos and other tools, which can help you get more usefull results for your specific needs are NOT included!

# üõ† Using in your projects
- Just copy necessary function (**ScaleSmoothGray** / **ScaleSmoothColor** / **ScaleRoughGray** and S255 / **ScaleRoughColor** and S255 / **ScaleFurryGray** and S255 / **ScaleFurryColor** and S255 / **ContrastBoldScaleGray**, S255f and S255 / **ContrastBoldScaleColor**, S255f and S255 / **ScaleSeparateGray**, Quadrilateral and Bilinear / **ScaleSeparateColor**, Quadrilateral and Bilinear / **ScaleBilinearApproximationGray**, Dist4 and Bilinear / **ScaleBilinearApproximationColor**, Dist4 and Bilinear) (you can harmless remove ProgressText from code)
- Call it with parameters (**image** as type Image, int **scale**, int **accuracy** - where 0 is fast, 100 is accurate)
- It returns new image as type **Image** <br>
